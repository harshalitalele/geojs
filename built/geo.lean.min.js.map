At a low level, the\n * camera provides a methods for converting between a map's coordinate system\n * to display pixel coordinates.\n *\n * For the moment, all camera transforms are assumed to be expressible as\n * 4x4 matrices.  More general cameras may follow that break this assumption.\n *\n * The interface for the camera is relatively stable for \"map-like\" views,\n * e.g. when the camera is pointing in the direction [0, 0, -1], and placed\n * above the z=0 plane.  More general view changes and events have not yet\n * been defined.\n *\n * The camera emits the following events when the view changes:\n *\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.pan} when the camera is translated in the\n *       x/y plane\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.zoom} when the camera is changed in a way\n *       that modifies the current zoom level\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.view} when the visible bounds change for\n *       any reason\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.projection} when the projection type changes\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.viewport} when the viewport changes\n *\n * By convention, protected methods do not update the internal matrix state,\n * public methods do.
